# ProcessPiper (Business Process Diagram as Code)
A python library to generate business process diagram using code. 

## Why ProcessPiper?
1. Generate professional business process diagrams with Python code, eliminating the need for manual drawing and complex tools.
2. Improve teamwork by utilising source code repositories for change monitoring, collaboration, and diagram history.
3. Enhance precision by generating diagrams with code, sharing/exporting them in PNG format, and integrating them with Python tools.

You can see the sample code and output for design concept below.

```python
from processpiper import ProcessMap, EventType, ActivityType, GatewayType

def test_case5():
    with ProcessMap(
        "Sample Test Process", colour_theme="BLUEMOUNTAIN"
    ) as my_process_map:
        with my_process_map.add_lane("End User") as lane1:
            start = lane1.add_element("Start", EventType.START)
            enter_keyword = lane1.add_element("Enter Keyword", ActivityType.TASK)

        with my_process_map.add_pool("System Search") as pool1:
            with pool1.add_lane("Database System") as lane2:
                login = lane2.add_element("Login", ActivityType.TASK)
                search_records = lane2.add_element("Search Records", ActivityType.TASK)
                result_found = lane2.add_element("Result Found?", GatewayType.EXCLUSIVE)
                display_result = lane2.add_element("Display Result", ActivityType.TASK)
                logout = lane2.add_element("Logout", ActivityType.TASK)
                end = lane2.add_element("End", EventType.END)

            with pool1.add_lane("Log System") as lane3:
                log_error = lane3.add_element("Log Error", ActivityType.TASK)

        start.connect(login, "User \nAuthenticates").connect(
            enter_keyword, "Authenticated"
        ).connect(search_records, "Search Criteria")
        search_records.connect(result_found, "Result").connect(display_result, "Yes")
        display_result.connect(logout).connect(end)
        result_found.connect(log_error, "No").connect(display_result)

        my_process_map.set_footer("Generated by ProcessPiper")
        my_process_map.draw()
        my_process_map.save("my_process_map_test_case05.png")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_case5()
```

## Development Status

It is still under development :construction: Beta version v0.1 will be release soon.

Initial release would only cover the following basic business process elements. Other element types will be introduced in subsequence releases.

* Event: Start, End, Timer, Intermediate
* Activity: Task, Subprocess
* Gateway: Inclusive, Exclusive, Parallel

Any ideas or suggestions, please send it to me via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/csgoh/processmapper/discussions).
